# Capstone-Crime-In-india
This project is done in 4 phases
1 st phase is collectng the data
        The population of each state.

       Literacy Rate in each state

      Area of each state


2Nd phase:State/UT wise Analysis of Data
           2.1	Analysis of Literacy Rate vs Total Crimes.

            2.2	 Analysis of the type of crime vs each state vs Literacy rate.

            2.3	Analysis of year-on-year total crime rate.


             2.4	 Analysis of area vs overall crime

             2.5	 Analysis of Population vs overall Crime

             2.6	Each state crime report. There is no fixed format to write a report, you can write a report inside the notebook itself based on what you have analyzed in the above points.

3rd phase:SQL Operations:
                3.1	Insert records from 42_District_wise_crimes_committed_against_women_2001_2012.csv into a table

               3.2	Write SQL query to find the highest number of rapes & Kidnappings that happened in which state, District, and year



                3.3	Write SQL query to find All the lowest number of rapes & Kidnappings that happened in which state, District, and year


                 3.4	Insert records from 02_District_wise_crimes_committed_against_ST_2001_2012.csv into a new table

                  3.5	Write SQL query to find the highest number of dacoity/robbery in which district.

                  3.6	Write SQL query to find in which districts(All) the lowest number of murders happened

                    3.7	Write SQL query to find the number of murders in ascending order in district and yearwise.

                    3.8.1	Insert records of STATE/UT, DISTRICT, YEAR, MURDER, ATTEMPT TO MURDER, and RAPE columns only from 01_District_wise_crimes_committed_IPC_2001_2012.csv into a new table

                  3.8.2	Write SQL query to find which District in each state/ut has the highest number of murders yearwise. Your output should show STATE/UT, YEAR, DISTRICT, and MURDERS.

                   3.8.3	Store the above data (the result of 3.2) in DataFrame and analyze districts that appear 3 or more than 3 years and print the corresponding state/ut, district, murders, and year in descending order.

                   3.8.4	Use appropriate graphs to show your data (the result of 3.8.3)


phase 4:Unsupervised ML (Clustering)
